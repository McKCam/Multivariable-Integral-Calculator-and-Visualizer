# Multivariable-Integral-Calculator-and-Visualizer

This is a JavaScript project that allows a user to enter multivariable math functions, modify bounds of integration for x and y variables, <br />
and visualize calculations. The result is placed in a read-only input box. <br />
<br />
The project uses the graphics library, p5.js for the visualization and DOM wrapper elements, alongside the WEBGL plugin for use of 3D graphics.<br />
The math.js library is also used for its parser and evaluator to allow the scaling for possible functions. <br />

Below is a screenshot labeling interfaces for users to interact with. <br />
